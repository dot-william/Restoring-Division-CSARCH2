## Application
- The web application computes for the quotient and remainder of two binary inputs using the Restoring Division Algorithm. In restoring division, the multiplier to the divisor is determined by first subtracting the divisor. If the result is negative, the divisor is restored (added back). After the restoring method, Q gets the quotient while A gets the remainder.

## Instructions
1. To use the website, binary numbers should be entered in the input fields.
2. Appropriate labels are shown to aid where appropriate values are to be entered (i.e., Dividend and Divisor).
3. Only a maximum of 16 bits are allowed to be entered for both fields.
4. Three options are provided: “Show Step-by-Step”, “Show All”, “Download Text File”. 
5. Choosing “Show Step-by-Step” shows the restoring method in a step-by-step manner by displaying each pass one at a time.
6. Choosing “Show All” shows all the results of the algorithm in one go.
7. Choosing “Download Text File” will prompt a downloaded text file containing the output results of the implemented algorithm.
8. Input fields will reset whenever a user enters a valid input.
9. Entering an invalid input or an empty input will restrict continuation of the algorithm.
